CONTRACTS â€“ MODULE 1: INTRO TO CONTRACT FORMATION

Lesson: Offer, Acceptance, and Consideration

A contract is a legally enforceable agreement. To be valid, it must include:
1. Offer: A clear proposal by one party (offeror) to another (offeree).
2. Acceptance: An unequivocal agreement to the terms of the offer.
3. Consideration: Something of value exchanged by both parties.

Example: If Alex offers to sell a bike to Jordan for $100, and Jordan says yes, the agreement is valid if both provide consideration (the bike and the money).
